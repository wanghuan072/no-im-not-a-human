## 🎮 About the Game

**No I'm Not a Human** is a psychological horror visual novel where extreme solar activity has made daytime survival impossible. As civilization collapses, you play as a survivor barricaded in an apartment, trying to survive the night by identifying dangerous **Visitors** disguised as humans seeking shelter.

The game explores themes of trust, paranoia, and survival in extreme circumstances, where the greatest threat might be the person you choose to help. Every decision is critical, as letting in the wrong person could be fatal.

### Game Story

As the sun draws closer to Earth, civilization has collapsed. The extreme heat during the day makes outdoor survival impossible, forcing the remaining population to seek shelter. But something else emerged in this new world - visitors who can mimic human appearance and behavior, but whose intentions remain unknown and deadly.

You must survive by identifying who is human and who is a visitor. Your survival depends on making the right choices, managing limited resources, and maintaining your sanity in this paranoid nightmare.

## ✨ Key Features
