//         <h2>Five Nights at Freddy's: The Ultimate Test of Nerve!</h2>

// <p>
// Welcome to the chilling world of Five Nights at Freddy's, where a seemingly innocent job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza transforms into a heart-pounding fight for survival. By day, it's a place of joy and laughter, but as darkness descends, the animatronics come alive with sinister intentions. Your role as the night security guard is simple: survive until morning. But can you withstand the relentless onslaught of Freddy and his menacing mechanical friends?

// </p>

// <h3>The Nightly Gauntlet: A Breakdown of Terror</h3>

// <p>
// Each night in Five Nights at Freddy's presents a unique set of challenges, escalating the tension and pushing your nerves to the limit. Understanding what to expect is crucial for survival:
// </p>

// <ol>
// <li><strong>Night 1:</strong> The unease begins. You'll notice subtle, unsettling movements, indicating that the animatronics are stirring.</li>
// <li><strong>Night 2:</strong> Freddy and his gang become more active, requiring you to employ your best defensive strategies to stay safe. Prepare for more frequent and aggressive encounters.</li>
// <li><strong>Night 3:</strong> The animatronics' movement rate increases drastically. They become faster, more unpredictable, and more relentless in their pursuit.</li>
// <li><strong>Night 4:</strong> This is where chaos truly reigns. One small error in judgment, one moment of hesitation, can spell your doom. Expect the unexpected and stay vigilant.</li>
// <li><strong>Night 5:</strong> The pinnacle of fear! The animatronics seem to be everywhere at once, attacking from all angles. Only unwavering focus and strategic thinking can see you through this final, terrifying night.</li>
// </ol>

// <h3>Core Gameplay Mechanics: Survival Strategies</h3>

// <p>
// Your survival in Five Nights at Freddy's hinges on your ability to manage resources and utilize the available tools effectively:
// </p>

// <ol>
// <li><strong>Electricity:</strong> This is your lifeline. It powers the lights and security doors that protect you from the animatronics. However, electricity is a finite resource.</li>
// <li><strong>Cameras:</strong> Your eyes and ears in the dark. Use them to monitor the animatronics' movements and anticipate their attacks. But remember, the camera system also consumes electricity!</li>
// <li><strong>Security Doors:</strong> Your primary defense against the animatronics. Close the doors to block their path, but be mindful of the energy drain. Leaving the doors closed for too long will deplete your power supply.</li>
// </ol>

// <h3>Tips for Surviving the Night</h3>

// <ol>
// <li><strong>Conserve Power:</strong> Avoid unnecessary use of lights and doors. Only activate them when absolutely necessary.</li>
// <li><strong>Monitor the Cameras Regularly:</strong> Keep track of the animatronics' locations to anticipate their movements and plan your defense.</li>
// <li><strong>Listen Carefully:</strong> Pay attention to audio cues, such as footsteps and breathing, which can indicate the presence of nearby animatronics.</li>
// </ol>

// <h3>FAQ</h3>

// <ol>
// <li><strong>What is the main objective of Five Nights at Freddy's?</strong></li>
// <li>
// The main objective is to survive each night shift (from midnight to 6 AM) at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza while avoiding the animatronics.
// </li>

// <li><strong>How do I protect myself from the animatronics?</strong></li>
