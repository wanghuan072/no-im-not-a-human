            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong><a href="/">No, I am not a human</a></strong> features a mysterious figure known as <strong>the Fetus</strong>, which appears exclusively in <strong><a href="/endings">Ending 1: Child of Doom</a></strong>. This guide details the steps and conditions to encounter the Fetus and achieve one of the game's most challenging endings.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Welcome the Seductive Woman</h3>
            <p>The player must encounter the <a href="/visitors">Seductive Woman</a> at the door. Allow her to enter the house and stay in the Protagonist's bed, located in the Bedroom. This is a critical decision that will set you on the path to this ending. Make sure you understand the <a href="/guides">visitor identification mechanics</a> before proceeding.</p>

                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-02.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Witness the Pregnancy Stages</h3>
            <p>Each night, the Seductive Woman's belly grows. She dismisses the Protagonist's concerns as paranoia. By the third night, her abdomen reaches maximum size. The next day, her body is found lifeless on the bed, her abdomen torn open and bloodied. This completes the pregnancy process.</p>

                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-06.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Find the Hidden Fetus</h3>
            <p>After the Seductive Woman's death, interact with the Bedroom curtains to trigger the Fetus's first appearance. It hides in multiple spots:</p>
            
             <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-07.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>
            
            <p>- <strong>Living Room:</strong> on a ceiling fan blade</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-08.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-09.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>

            <p>- <strong>Bathroom:</strong> inside a washing tub beneath the bathtub</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-10.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-11.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>
            
            <p>Each time it is found, a crying sound plays. Completing both hiding spots allows the player to return to bed. This step can be completed in a single day. If you're struggling with the game's mechanics, check out our <a href="/guides">survival strategies guide</a> for more tips.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Witness the Fetus Feeding Itself</h3>
            <p>At night, look through the left blinded window. The Fetus has transformed into a child and appears pressed against a hound, feeding on the dog's milk.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-12.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>

            <blockquote>
                "You see that child again. But what is it doing over there? Is it devouring a dog? ...No. They're pressed close to the animal's chest. You stand frozen, unable to move. Why won't it go to its mother? Was she ever truly pregnant? As you ponder this, the world outside fades from view, swallowed whole by a thick fog."
            </blockquote>
    
            <h3>Step 5: Trigger the Ending Cutscene</h3>
            <p>After witnessing the child, other windows become inaccessible. Looking through the peephole will trigger the <a href="/endings">Ending 1: Child of Doom</a> cutscene automatically. This is one of ten possible endings in the game - explore our <a href="/endings">complete endings guide</a> to discover all possible outcomes.</p>
    
            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <p>Some speculate the child represents the Antichrist. The Seductive Woman may symbolize Babylon the Great, who gave birth to the Antichrist. Biblical references connect the Antichrist's appearance with the Great Tribulation. The scene of the child feeding on a dog may draw inspiration from Romulus and Remus, who were nourished by a she-wolf.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Killing in <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong> is unavoidable, but the real question is whether you made the right call. <a href="/visitors">Visitors</a> and humans leave behind different signs after death. Knowing these signs lets you confirm if your paranoia was justified, or if you just killed an innocent guest. This guide will help you understand the aftermath of your deadly decisions.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/2.webp" alt="Death aftermath in No I'm Not a Human" />
            </div>

            <h2>Human Deaths in the Game</h2>
            <p>When you kill a human, their body is not shown directly. Instead, <strong>three bloody body bags</strong> appear. This visual is consistent for every human victim. It is the game's way of making sure you feel the weight of the mistake.</p>
            
            <p>The body bag system serves as a constant reminder of your errors in judgment. Each time you see those three bags, you know you've taken an innocent life. This mechanic reinforces the psychological horror aspect of the game, making you question every decision. For more on managing this pressure, check our <a href="/guides">survival strategies guide</a>.</p>

            <h2>Visitor Deaths in No I'm Not a Human</h2>
            <p>When you kill a <a href="/visitors">Visitor</a>, the outcome is very different. Visitors leave behind <strong>their corpse</strong> rather than body bags. On top of that, your vision distorts for a moment, showing <strong>uncanny, inhuman faces</strong>. This effect is unique to Visitors and confirms that the guest you killed was not human.</p>
            
            <p>The vision distortion is a key gameplay mechanic that provides immediate feedback. These disturbing visual effects serve as both confirmation and reward - you made the right call, but the game still reminds you of the horror you've witnessed. The corpse remains visible, unlike human victims who are discretely bagged.</p>

            <h3>Key Differences Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Human Death:</strong> Three bloody body bags appear, no corpse visible</li>
                <li><strong>Visitor Death:</strong> Corpse remains visible, vision distorts with inhuman faces</li>
                <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> The visual difference is your only way to know for certain</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Randomized Characters</h2>
            <p>Not every character has a fixed role, which means sometimes it can be hard to tell before the shot. <strong>Wheelchair Lady</strong>, <strong>Beer Man</strong>, the <strong>Woman with a Child</strong>, and the <strong>Stooped Woman</strong> are all examples of randomized roles. Their deaths follow the same body bag or corpse system, making the aftermath your only clear confirmation.</p>
            
            <p>This randomization system adds significant replay value to <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong>. You cannot rely on memorization alone - each playthrough requires careful observation and judgment. The uncertainty forces you to actually examine guests rather than following a memorized pattern. Learn more about <a href="/visitors">all visitor types</a> in our comprehensive database.</p>

            <h2>Fixed Roles</h2>
            <p>Some guests are always safe or always dangerous (see the complete <a href="/visitors">list of all visitors here</a>). The <strong>Tall Man</strong>, <strong>Widow</strong>, <strong>Neighbor's Daughter</strong>, and <strong>Fireman</strong> are guaranteed humans. The <strong>Cashier Girl</strong>, <strong>Amogus Man</strong>, and the <strong>Intruder</strong> are guaranteed Visitors. These do not require guesswork, so their deaths will always match their confirmed role.</p>
            
            <p>Understanding which characters are fixed can significantly improve your survival rate. However, relying too heavily on this knowledge can make you complacent with randomized characters. The game balances memorization with observation skills, creating a more engaging experience. For strategies on managing both fixed and random guests, visit our <a href="/guides">complete gameplay guide</a>.</p>

            <h3>Confirmed Safe Characters (Always Human)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tall Man</strong> - Always produces body bags when killed</li>
                <li><strong>Widow</strong> - Despite red eyes from crying, always human</li>
                <li><strong>Neighbor's Daughter</strong> - Guaranteed safe to admit</li>
                <li><strong>Fireman</strong> - Always human, never a threat</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Confirmed Threats (Always Visitors)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cashier Girl</strong> - Always leaves a corpse when killed</li>
                <li><strong>Amogus Man</strong> - Guaranteed Visitor, eliminate immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Intruder</strong> - Always dangerous, always a Visitor</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p><strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong> uses death visuals to tell you if you killed a <a href="/visitors">Visitor</a> or a human. Body bags mean you killed a person. A corpse with distorted visions means you killed a Visitor. This simple difference is the game's way of holding you accountable, forcing you to live with each choice after the knock on your door.</p>
            
            <p>The psychological weight of these decisions is what makes the game memorable. Every kill matters, and the visual feedback system ensures you always know the consequences. Whether you're aiming for a specific <a href="/endings">ending</a> or just trying to survive, understanding these death mechanics is crucial to your success.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>How do you know if you killed a Visitor?</h3>
            <p>Visitors leave corpses, and your vision distorts with uncanny, inhuman faces when they die. This visual distortion is immediate and unmistakable, providing clear confirmation that you eliminated a threat.</p>

            <h3>How do you know if you killed a human?</h3>
            <p>Killing a human shows three bloody body bags instead of a corpse. The body is never shown directly, only the bags containing the remains.</p>

            <h3>Are all characters fixed as human or Visitor?</h3>
            <p>No. Some are fixed, like the Tall Man (human) or Cashier Girl (Visitor), but many are randomized. Characters like Wheelchair Lady, Beer Man, Woman with a Child, and Stooped Woman can be either human or Visitor depending on the playthrough. Check our <a href="/visitors">complete visitor database</a> for detailed information.</p>

            <h3>Do all Visitors show the same death signs?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Every Visitor death shows a corpse and vision distortion. This consistency makes it easy to confirm your kills, regardless of which Visitor type you eliminated.</p>

            <h3>Can the Widow be mistaken for a Visitor?</h3>
            <p>Yes. She has red eyes from crying, which can look like a Visitor trait. However, if killed, she produces body bags, confirming she is always human. Her red eyes are from grief, not from being a Visitor. Learn more about identifying <a href="/visitors">visitor traits</a> in our guide.</p>
