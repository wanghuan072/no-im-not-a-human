            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong><a href="/">No, I am not a human</a></strong> features a mysterious figure known as <strong>the Fetus</strong>, which appears exclusively in <strong><a href="/endings">Ending 1: Child of Doom</a></strong>. This guide details the steps and conditions to encounter the Fetus and achieve one of the game's most challenging endings.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Welcome the Seductive Woman</h3>
            <p>The player must encounter the <a href="/visitors">Seductive Woman</a> at the door. Allow her to enter the house and stay in the Protagonist's bed, located in the Bedroom. This is a critical decision that will set you on the path to this ending. Make sure you understand the <a href="/guides">visitor identification mechanics</a> before proceeding.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Witness the Pregnancy Stages</h3>
            <p>Each night, the Seductive Woman's belly grows. She dismisses the Protagonist's concerns as paranoia. By the third night, her abdomen reaches maximum size. The next day, her body is found lifeless on the bed, her abdomen torn open and bloodied. This completes the pregnancy process.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Find the Hidden Fetus</h3>
            <p>After the Seductive Woman's death, interact with the Bedroom curtains to trigger the Fetus's first appearance. It hides in multiple spots:</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>- <strong>Living Room:</strong> on a ceiling fan blade</p>

                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-09.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>

            <p>- <strong>Bathroom:</strong> inside a washing tub beneath the bathtub</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-10.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-11.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>
            
            <p>Each time it is found, a crying sound plays. Completing both hiding spots allows the player to return to bed. This step can be completed in a single day. If you're struggling with the game's mechanics, check out our <a href="/guides">survival strategies guide</a> for more tips.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Witness the Fetus Feeding Itself</h3>
            <p>At night, look through the left blinded window. The Fetus has transformed into a child and appears pressed against a hound, feeding on the dog's milk.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-12.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>

            <blockquote>
                "You see that child again. But what is it doing over there? Is it devouring a dog? ...No. They're pressed close to the animal's chest. You stand frozen, unable to move. Why won't it go to its mother? Was she ever truly pregnant? As you ponder this, the world outside fades from view, swallowed whole by a thick fog."
            </blockquote>
    
            <h3>Step 5: Trigger the Ending Cutscene</h3>
            <p>After witnessing the child, other windows become inaccessible. Looking through the peephole will trigger the <a href="/endings">Ending 1: Child of Doom</a> cutscene automatically. This is one of ten possible endings in the game - explore our <a href="/endings">complete endings guide</a> to discover all possible outcomes.</p>
    
            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <p>Some speculate the child represents the Antichrist. The Seductive Woman may symbolize Babylon the Great, who gave birth to the Antichrist. Biblical references connect the Antichrist's appearance with the Great Tribulation. The scene of the child feeding on a dog may draw inspiration from Romulus and Remus, who were nourished by a she-wolf.
