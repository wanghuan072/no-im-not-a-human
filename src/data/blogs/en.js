            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong><a href="/">No, I am not a human</a></strong> features a mysterious figure known as <strong>the Fetus</strong>, which appears exclusively in <strong><a href="/endings">Ending 1: Child of Doom</a></strong>. This guide details the steps and conditions to encounter the Fetus and achieve one of the game's most challenging endings.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Welcome the Seductive Woman</h3>
            <p>The player must encounter the <a href="/visitors">Seductive Woman</a> at the door. Allow her to enter the house and stay in the Protagonist's bed, located in the Bedroom. This is a critical decision that will set you on the path to this ending. Make sure you understand the <a href="/guides">visitor identification mechanics</a> before proceeding.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Witness the Pregnancy Stages</h3>
            <p>Each night, the Seductive Woman's belly grows. She dismisses the Protagonist's concerns as paranoia. By the third night, her abdomen reaches maximum size. The next day, her body is found lifeless on the bed, her abdomen torn open and bloodied. This completes the pregnancy process.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Find the Hidden Fetus</h3>
            <p>After the Seductive Woman's death, interact with the Bedroom curtains to trigger the Fetus's first appearance. It hides in multiple spots:</p>

                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-09.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>

            <p>- <strong>Bathroom:</strong> inside a washing tub beneath the bathtub</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-10.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-11.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>
            
            <p>Each time it is found, a crying sound plays. Completing both hiding spots allows the player to return to bed. This step can be completed in a single day. If you're struggling with the game's mechanics, check out our <a href="/guides">survival strategies guide</a> for more tips.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Witness the Fetus Feeding Itself</h3>
            <p>At night, look through the left blinded window. The Fetus has transformed into a child and appears pressed against a hound, feeding on the dog's milk.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog01-12.webp" alt="The Fetus in No, I am not a human" />
            </div>

            <blockquote>
                "You see that child again. But what is it doing over there? Is it devouring a dog? ...No. They're pressed close to the animal's chest. You stand frozen, unable to move. Why won't it go to its mother? Was she ever truly pregnant? As you ponder this, the world outside fades from view, swallowed whole by a thick fog."
            </blockquote>
    
            <h3>Step 5: Trigger the Ending Cutscene</h3>
            <p>After witnessing the child, other windows become inaccessible. Looking through the peephole will trigger the <a href="/endings">Ending 1: Child of Doom</a> cutscene automatically. This is one of ten possible endings in the game - explore our <a href="/endings">complete endings guide</a> to discover all possible outcomes.</p>
    
            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <p>Some speculate the child represents the Antichrist. The Seductive Woman may symbolize Babylon the Great, who gave birth to the Antichrist. Biblical references connect the Antichrist's appearance with the Great Tribulation. The scene of the child feeding on a dog may draw inspiration from Romulus and Remus, who were nourished by a she-wolf.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Killing in <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong> is unavoidable, but the real question is whether you made the right call. <a href="/visitors">Visitors</a> and humans leave behind different signs after death. Knowing these signs lets you confirm if your paranoia was justified, or if you just killed an innocent guest. This guide will help you understand the aftermath of your deadly decisions.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/images/blog/blog02-02.webp" alt="Death aftermath in No I'm Not a Human" />
            </div>

            <h2>Human Deaths in the Game</h2>
            <p>When you kill a human, their body is not shown directly. Instead, <strong>three bloody body bags</strong> appear. This visual is consistent for every human victim. It is the game's way of making sure you feel the weight of the mistake.</p>
            
            <p>The body bag system serves as a constant reminder of your errors in judgment. Each time you see those three bags, you know you've taken an innocent life. This mechanic reinforces the psychological horror aspect of the game, making you question every decision. For more on managing this pressure, check our <a href="/guides">survival strategies guide</a>.</p>

            <h2>Visitor Deaths in No I'm Not a Human</h2>
            <p>When you kill a <a href="/visitors">Visitor</a>, the outcome is very different. Visitors leave behind <strong>their corpse</strong> rather than body bags. On top of that, your vision distorts for a moment, showing <strong>uncanny, inhuman faces</strong>. This effect is unique to Visitors and confirms that the guest you killed was not human.</p>
            
            <p>The vision distortion is a key gameplay mechanic that provides immediate feedback. These disturbing visual effects serve as both confirmation and reward - you made the right call, but the game still reminds you of the horror you've witnessed. The corpse remains visible, unlike human victims who are discretely bagged.</p>

            <h3>Key Differences Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Human Death:</strong> Three bloody body bags appear, no corpse visible</li>
                <li><strong>Visitor Death:</strong> Corpse remains visible, vision distorts with inhuman faces</li>
                <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> The visual difference is your only way to know for certain</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Randomized Characters</h2>
            <p>Not every character has a fixed role, which means sometimes it can be hard to tell before the shot. <strong>Wheelchair Lady</strong>, <strong>Beer Man</strong>, the <strong>Woman with a Child</strong>, and the <strong>Stooped Woman</strong> are all examples of randomized roles. Their deaths follow the same body bag or corpse system, making the aftermath your only clear confirmation.</p>
            
            <p>This randomization system adds significant replay value to <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong>. You cannot rely on memorization alone - each playthrough requires careful observation and judgment. The uncertainty forces you to actually examine guests rather than following a memorized pattern. Learn more about <a href="/visitors">all visitor types</a> in our comprehensive database.</p>

            <h2>Fixed Roles</h2>
            <p>Some guests are always safe or always dangerous (see the complete <a href="/visitors">list of all visitors here</a>). The <strong>Tall Man</strong>, <strong>Widow</strong>, <strong>Neighbor's Daughter</strong>, and <strong>Fireman</strong> are guaranteed humans. The <strong>Cashier Girl</strong>, <strong>Amogus Man</strong>, and the <strong>Intruder</strong> are guaranteed Visitors. These do not require guesswork, so their deaths will always match their confirmed role.</p>
            
            <p>Understanding which characters are fixed can significantly improve your survival rate. However, relying too heavily on this knowledge can make you complacent with randomized characters. The game balances memorization with observation skills, creating a more engaging experience. For strategies on managing both fixed and random guests, visit our <a href="/guides">complete gameplay guide</a>.</p>

            <h3>Confirmed Safe Characters (Always Human)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tall Man</strong> - Always produces body bags when killed</li>
                <li><strong>Widow</strong> - Despite red eyes from crying, always human</li>
                <li><strong>Neighbor's Daughter</strong> - Guaranteed safe to admit</li>
                <li><strong>Fireman</strong> - Always human, never a threat</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Confirmed Threats (Always Visitors)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cashier Girl</strong> - Always leaves a corpse when killed</li>
                <li><strong>Amogus Man</strong> - Guaranteed Visitor, eliminate immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Intruder</strong> - Always dangerous, always a Visitor</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p><strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong> uses death visuals to tell you if you killed a <a href="/visitors">Visitor</a> or a human. Body bags mean you killed a person. A corpse with distorted visions means you killed a Visitor. This simple difference is the game's way of holding you accountable, forcing you to live with each choice after the knock on your door.</p>
            
            <p>The psychological weight of these decisions is what makes the game memorable. Every kill matters, and the visual feedback system ensures you always know the consequences. Whether you're aiming for a specific <a href="/endings">ending</a> or just trying to survive, understanding these death mechanics is crucial to your success.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>How do you know if you killed a Visitor?</h3>
            <p>Visitors leave corpses, and your vision distorts with uncanny, inhuman faces when they die. This visual distortion is immediate and unmistakable, providing clear confirmation that you eliminated a threat.</p>

            <h3>How do you know if you killed a human?</h3>
            <p>Killing a human shows three bloody body bags instead of a corpse. The body is never shown directly, only the bags containing the remains.</p>

            <h3>Are all characters fixed as human or Visitor?</h3>
            <p>No. Some are fixed, like the Tall Man (human) or Cashier Girl (Visitor), but many are randomized. Characters like Wheelchair Lady, Beer Man, Woman with a Child, and Stooped Woman can be either human or Visitor depending on the playthrough. Check our <a href="/visitors">complete visitor database</a> for detailed information.</p>

            <h3>Do all Visitors show the same death signs?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Every Visitor death shows a corpse and vision distortion. This consistency makes it easy to confirm your kills, regardless of which Visitor type you eliminated.</p>

            <h3>Can the Widow be mistaken for a Visitor?</h3>
            <p>Yes. She has red eyes from crying, which can look like a Visitor trait. However, if killed, she produces body bags, confirming she is always human. Her red eyes are from grief, not from being a Visitor. Learn more about identifying <a href="/visitors">visitor traits</a> in our guide.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Survival in <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong> isn't just about fighting <a href="/visitors">visitors</a>; it's about noticing the small, terrifying details in your apartment. From mysterious items like the Mushroom to the unsettling sounds of <strong>window knocking</strong>, the game is filled with secrets that many players miss on their first playthrough. In this comprehensive guide, we explore the hidden interactions and environmental storytelling that make this <a href="/guides">psychological horror game</a> truly nightmare-inducing.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>1. Understanding Sound Cues: The Window Knocking</h2>
            <p>Sound is your best friend and your worst enemy in <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong>. A common question among players is: <strong>"What is the window knocking in I'm not a human?"</strong> This mysterious sound effect puzzles many players during their first encounters with the game.</p>
            
            <h3>Atmosphere vs. Threat</h3>
            <p>Unlike footsteps in the hallway (which signal a <a href="/visitors">Visitor</a> approaching), the tapping on the window is often designed to increase your paranoia. This atmospheric sound effect serves to build tension and make you question whether the threat is real or imagined. Understanding the difference between <strong>window knocking</strong> sounds and actual threats is crucial for maintaining your sanity in this <a href="/guides">survival horror experience</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>What You Should Do</h3>
            <p>When you hear the <strong>window knocking</strong>, <strong>do not open the window</strong>. In the world of No I'm Not a Human, your apartment is your only safe zone. Strange noises outside are indicators that the world has been overrun. Stay away from the glass and focus on the peephole—that is where the real danger comes from. The <strong>window knocking sound</strong> in No I'm Not a Human serves as a constant reminder that threats exist beyond your walls.</p>
            
            <p>The <strong>window knocking</strong> is a psychological tool used by the game to maintain constant tension. It reminds you that the horror isn't just inside your apartment—it's everywhere, and your sanctuary is fragile.

            <h2>2. The Emergency Broadcasts (Lore)</h2>
            <p>Players often search for the <strong>"FEMA number"</strong> or <strong>"FEMA no I'm not a human"</strong> contacts within the game, hoping to find a way to contact authorities or emergency services. Many wonder: <strong>"What is the FEMA number in No I'm Not a Human?"</strong></p>
            
            <h3>The State of the World</h3>
            <p>Through TV broadcasts and notes scattered throughout your apartment, you realize that the authorities have lost control. While players often look for a <strong>"FEMA"</strong> style organization to save them, the game makes it clear: <strong>Help is not coming</strong>. The world outside has collapsed, and you are truly alone. The search for a <strong>FEMA number in No I'm Not a Human</strong> is ultimately futile—there is no emergency response system left to contact.</p>
            
            <h3>Phone Interactions</h3>
            <p>You may find phone numbers or codes during gameplay. Dialing these can reveal hidden lore or static messages, reinforcing the isolation theme. These interactions serve as world-building elements that deepen the game's atmosphere of hopelessness and abandonment. While you might find references to <strong>FEMA</strong> or government agencies, none of these contacts will provide actual help in <strong>No I'm Not a Human</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>The absence of a working <strong>FEMA contact number</strong> is intentional—it's part of the game's design to make you feel completely isolated. There is no rescue coming, no government aid, no way out except through your own <a href="/guides">survival skills</a>. This realization is one of the most terrifying aspects of the game. Understanding that <strong>FEMA no I'm not a human</strong> means no help is coming is crucial for surviving the game's psychological horror.</p>

            <h2>3. Hidden Items: The Mushroom</h2>
            <p>Exploration yields strange results in <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong>. One of the oddest items you can find is <strong>the Mushroom</strong>. This mysterious item is part of the game's hidden <a href="/wiki">world lore</a> and environmental storytelling.</p>
            
            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p>Keep an eye on the corners of the rooms or damp areas during the exploration phase. The Mushroom can appear in unexpected places, often in areas that seem insignificant at first glance. Finding hidden items like the Mushroom requires careful observation and thorough exploration of your apartment.</p>
            
            <h3>Interaction</h3>
            <p>Finding the mushroom contributes to the game's "weird" achievement list or specific interactions. It serves as a reminder that the corruption isn't just affecting the people—it's affecting the environment itself. The presence of such strange items suggests that the transformation happening to the world is more profound than it first appears. These <a href="/wiki">hidden items</a> are essential for understanding the full scope of the game's horror narrative.</p>
            
            <p>These environmental details are crucial for understanding the full scope of the game's horror. They hint at a world where reality itself is breaking down, where normal objects can become strange and threatening.

            <h2>4. The "Immortal Man" and Key Figures</h2>
            <p>While listening for knocks and reading notes, you must never forget <strong>the Immortal Man</strong>. This character is one of the most mysterious figures in <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>Who Is the Immortal Man?</h3>
            <p>He is not just a random <a href="/visitors">visitor</a>. He is a persistent threat woven into the game's background. Unlike standard enemies, he represents the inevitability of the game's horror. The Immortal Man cannot be permanently defeated, and his presence serves as a constant reminder that some threats are beyond your control. Understanding the <strong>Immortal Man in No I'm Not a Human</strong> is key to surviving the game's most challenging moments.</p>
            
            <h3>Survival Tip</h3>
            <p>If you see him, standard combat might not be the answer. Run or hide. The Immortal Man represents forces beyond normal comprehension, and direct confrontation often leads to failure. Understanding when to fight and when to flee is crucial for survival in this game. For more <a href="/guides">survival strategies</a> and tips on dealing with the Immortal Man, check our <a href="/guides">complete gameplay guide</a>.</p>
            
            <p>His existence adds another layer of psychological horror to the experience. He represents the unstoppable nature of the corruption spreading through the world.

            <h2>5. Connecting the Secrets: How Everything Fits Together</h2>
            <p>Understanding how these secrets connect is crucial for mastering <strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong>. The <strong>window knocking</strong> sounds, the absence of <strong>FEMA numbers</strong>, the mysterious Mushroom, and the Immortal Man all tell a story of a world in collapse. Each element contributes to the game's atmosphere of isolation and despair.</p>
            
            <p>These environmental details work together to create a sense of hopelessness. The <strong>window knocking in No I'm Not a Human</strong> reminds you that threats exist outside. The lack of <strong>FEMA contact</strong> confirms that no help is coming. The strange items like the Mushroom show that corruption is spreading. And the Immortal Man represents forces beyond your control. Together, they create the perfect psychological horror experience.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p><strong><a href="/">No I'm Not a Human</a></strong> is a masterclass in lo-fi horror. The <strong>window knocking</strong>, the useless emergency numbers (including the non-existent <strong>FEMA number</strong>), and the strange items all build a world where you are completely alone. These environmental details and hidden interactions are what make the game truly terrifying—not just the jump scares, but the constant sense of isolation and the knowledge that help will never come.</p>
            
            <p>Every sound, every item, every note you find tells a story of a world that has already ended. Your survival depends not just on identifying <a href="/visitors">threats</a>, but on understanding that you are truly on your own.
